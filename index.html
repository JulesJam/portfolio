        <p class="flowing">Hi. I am 'JulesJam'. My name is Julian Wyatt, you may ask why I have called my site 'JulesJam', it's a long story but Jam and Jam making seem to have popped up a number of times in my life and at one point I considered setting up a business making jam, however after one week of peeling oranges to make marmalade I began to think maybe that jam making was not the way forward! But I liked the name JulesJam which I had used for labelling and it kind of stuck...<p>

        <h3>So here is a little more about me...</h3>
        <img class="flow icons" src="images/mortar_pestle.png" alt="Icon mortar & pestle" title = "mortar & pestle">
        <p class="flowing">I qualified as a registered Pharmacist in 1989 – I resigned from the register in 2016 to pursue a new career in technology. Throughout my Pharmacy career I have very much focused on using technology to improve and enrich the businesses I have worked for. From helping to implement early EPOS systems to working with developers on an interactive online Doctor site more recently working with Webstar-Health in their development of a site to enable communication between Community and Hospital Pharmacists.</p>
        <img class="flow icons" src="images/coding.png" alt="Icon of a laptop with code" title = "Icon of a laptop with code">

        <p class = "flowing"> Along the way I have taught myself Basic, DOS, QBasic, Visual Basic, Filemaker Scripting language, basic HTML, CSS, PHP and HL7.

        This year I was able to take time to undertake formal web devloper training with General Assembly, attending the Web Development Immersive course for 12 weeks through the summer of 2016. Over the 12 weeks we covered a whole host of the most up to date technologies, as listed in the education section of my site. I realise there is still alot to learn but now have a good formal grounding in web development.

        <p class ="flowing">When I’m not undertaking an immersive coding course I keep myself busy with cycling, gardening, cooking, or travelling. I am also a keen but very much amateur photographer and so I usually like to combine all of these things by travelling to new places, if possible cycling around and trying the cuisine whilst taking photos. I am also very much interested in technology and science, I read New Scientist Magazine every week and bore my husband with Quantum Physics although this again is very much in an amateur way!

      <p>Here are the projects I have worked on. The first four are projects which I created during the Full Stack Web Developer Course that I undertook through <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>. They are all pretty much minimum viable products and are not fully debugged. I hope to be adding more very soon!

      <p>If you have already read the 'Who is..' section of my site you will know that I completed the Web Development Immersive at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> in London. The course covered a wide gamut of technolgies
      <p>These are the technologies which I have worked with to date....</p>

      <p>Whilst I have worked with all of the above there is plenty more to learn and I am always keen to work on developing my knowledge either of my exisiting skills or to take on new ones. I also have some leaning towards backend technology and skills.
