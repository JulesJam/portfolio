    Hello. My name is Julian Wyatt, if you have landed on this page you must have scanned my business card, thank you for taking the time to do that. I have just completed the Web Development Immersive at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> in London and am now hoping to start a new career in web development. I know there is a huge amount more to learn, but I do feel that in addition to what I have learnt at General Assembly I have quite a bit of other experience from my previous career in Pharmacy. I should emphasise that I am looking for a junior developers job currently and I am happy to accept an Intern or similar position. In all my other jobs I have started at the bottom and worked my way up so I am not afraid of making the tea or doing the lunch run, I am just really excited about doing something I have wanted to do for many years so hopefully we will speak again... In the meanwhile feel free to <a href='mailto:julian@julesjam.com'>mail</a> me. Alternatively to learn more please click my CV below or go to my main site<a href="index.html" alt="link to main site"> JulesJam.com</a>
